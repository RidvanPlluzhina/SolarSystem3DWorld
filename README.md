# **SolarSystem3DWorld**

## 🌍 **Overview**

**SolarSystem3DWorld** is a Unity-based project designed to show the solar system in an interactive way. The Unity scene brings planets and celestial objects to life with animations and sound effects. It offers a fun and educational way to explore the solar system. This project can work alone or connect with an Arduino system for more features.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

In this Unity project, users can:

- See planets rotating, orbiting, and glowing.
- Watch animations for the Sun, Moon, and other celestial objects.
- Listen to audio descriptions of planets.
- Experience a realistic rocket launch animation.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Unity 3D Visualizations:** Includes animations for planets, the Sun, and the Moon.
- **Dynamic Skybox:** Rotating skybox to create a space-like experience.
- **Rocket Launch Simulation:** A detailed rocket launch animation.
- **Audio Feedback:** Unique sound descriptions for each planet.
- **Camera Transitions:** Smooth movements for an immersive experience.
- **Reset Button:** Brings the scene back to its starting point.

## 🎮 **Unity Scripts**

### 1. **ArduinoCommunication.cs**

- Handles messages from Arduino to start animations or sounds in Unity.
- Controls animations for planets, the rocket, and the Sun.
- Includes a reset function to restart the scene.

### 2. **SkyboxRotation.cs**

- Rotates the skybox to simulate space movement.

### 3. **MessageListener.cs**

- Logs messages received from Arduino to Unity.
